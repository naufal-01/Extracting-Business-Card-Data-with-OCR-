Extracting Business Card Data with OCR
This project demonstrates how to extract data from business cards using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. By converting images of business cards into structured digital data, you can efficiently manage contact information.

Features
Image Capture: Scan or photograph business cards.
Pre-processing: Enhance image quality (grayscale conversion, noise reduction).
Text Detection and Extraction: Use OCR tools like Tesseract or Google Vision to identify and convert text.
Data Structuring: Organize extracted data into fields (Name, Title, Company, Phone Number, Email).
Error Correction: Review and correct OCR misinterpretations.
Data Storage: Save structured data in a database or contact management system.
Steps to Use
Capture Image:

Scan or take a high-resolution photo of the business card.
Pre-process Image:

Convert the image to grayscale.
Apply noise reduction and contrast adjustment.
Extract Text:

Use an OCR tool to detect and extract text from the image.
Structure Data:

Parse the extracted text into appropriate fields (e.g., Name, Title).
